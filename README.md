## About
This is a complete full stack web application that utilizes the popular MVC design pattern.
There is a very basic user interface that interacts with an API and performs all CRUD operations on the database.
The interface allows a user to enter the name of a burger, click a button, and the burger will be saved to the database. Once saved, the burger can be 'devoured' which will update the database record, or 'removed' which will delete the database record.
